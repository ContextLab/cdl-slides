## T: Your poster title goes here

## A brief subtitle that captures the main finding or question

**Author One**¹, **Author Two**¹², **Author Three**²

¹ Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Dartmouth College | ² Collaborating Institution

## I: Introduction and motivation

<div class="note-box" data-title="Orient your audience">

Start with the **broad question** your research addresses. Why should the reader care? Narrow from the big picture to your specific contribution in 3–5 sentences.

</div>

<div class="note-box" data-title="What to include">

- The **big-picture problem** your work addresses
- Why existing approaches fall short
- Your specific **research question** or hypothesis
- A visual or diagram that captures the core idea

</div>

<div class="note-box" data-title="Less is more">

Aim for **minimal text** and **maximal visual impact**. A reader should grasp your motivation in under 30 seconds. Use a figure instead of a paragraph wherever possible.

</div>

## M: Methods

<div class="definition-box" data-title="Experimental design">

Describe your **paradigm** concisely: number of participants, key conditions, stimuli, and procedure. A flow diagram is ideal here.

</div>

<div class="definition-box" data-title="Analysis pipeline">

Show your pipeline as a visual flow: **collection → preprocessing → modeling → validation**. A diagram works best here.

</div>

<div class="definition-box" data-title="Figures over formulas">

Prefer **diagrams and flowcharts** over dense notation. Limit to one or two key formulas at most.

</div>

<div class="definition-box" data-title="Tools and code">

List key software and libraries used. If your code is open source, include a link or QR code to the repository.

</div>

## R: Results

<div class="example-box" data-title="Tell a story with your data">

Lead with your **most critical result** first, then provide supporting evidence. Every figure should have a clear, self-explanatory takeaway message.

</div>

<div class="example-box" data-title="Figure 1: Main result">

Place your **primary finding** here. The figure should be self-explanatory — a reader should understand the key message without reading surrounding text.

</div>

<div class="example-box" data-title="Figure 2: Supporting evidence">

Additional results that **support or extend** your main finding. Use tables for quantitative comparisons, or multi-panel figures for consistency across conditions.

</div>

<div class="example-box" data-title="Statistical reporting">

Report key statistics concisely. Use a small **table** for multiple comparisons, or annotate figures directly with significance markers.

</div>

<div class="example-box" data-title="Common pitfall">

Don't overcrowd this section. **Two or three well-designed figures** are far more effective than five cramped ones. Leave white space for visual breathing room.

</div>

<div class="example-box" data-title="Figure 3: Replication">

If applicable, show that your findings **generalize** across datasets, conditions, or participant groups. This strengthens the impact of your main result.

</div>

## C: Conclusions and future directions

<div class="tip-box" data-title="Summary of findings">

Restate your **key findings** in 2–3 bullet points. Connect them back to the motivating question from the introduction.

</div>

<div class="tip-box" data-title="Broader impact">

Explain why your findings **matter** beyond the specific experiment — theoretical, clinical, or practical implications.

</div>

<div class="tip-box" data-title="Limitations">

Acknowledge **limitations** honestly and note how future work might address them.

</div>

<div class="tip-box" data-title="Future directions">

- Next experiments you plan to run
- Extensions of the current approach
- Open questions raised by your findings

</div>

## D: References and acknowledgments

<div class="warning-box" data-title="References">

Include **5–10 key citations** most relevant to your work. Use a numbered list with abbreviated journal names. Prioritize citations the reader might actually look up.

</div>

<div class="warning-box" data-title="Acknowledgments and funding">

Thank funding agencies (with grant numbers), collaborators, and lab members. Mention shared resources and institutional support.
